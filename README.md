# Grade-Assignment-Reminder

This is a personal project that I'm currently developing. It is not finished and still has many flaws in the program. I decided to make this program as I wanted to make something that would be useful for students when it comes to assignments or exams to remind them when a particular assignment is due or where and when a particular exam is and many other features I wish to implement. 

I also made the program robust in case the user forgets to provide certain details or enters the wrong information.

As I was developing this program, I also provided comments to what each block of code does/mean to help others who are new to programming and help them have a solid understanding. However there are some comments that I have written to myself to further develop this program, please try to disregard that.

I'm currently developing this in Java, once I have finished developing this program in Java I wish to develop it in C++ as well.
